Logos for various of my Things
===========

This repo contains various logos in DXF format which can be put on things
(e.g. to show affiliation or to promote the respective entity). I often use
them for my things, for example on [bottle name
tags](https://github.com/rohieb/bottle-clip-name-tag).

Most of the logos are fairly low-res, unless otherwise noted. (This is
neccessary because apparently OpenSCAD cannot process DXF files with curved
segments, so all segments must be lines.)

Licence

The files themselves are in the public domain. Note that for probably all of
them, additional third-party trademarks may apply individually.
